# JWTweak

### Introduction
This tool is basically designed to automate the progress of changing the JWT algorithm of input JWT Token and then generate the new JWT based on changed algorithm.

#### Features
- Detect the algorithm of the input JWT Token 
- Base64 decode the input JWT Token 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'None' 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'HS256' 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'HS384' 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'HS512' 
                    

### Changelogs
#### Version-1.0 (28-Apr-2020)
#### Feature
- Option to Detect the algorithm of the input JWT
- Base64 decode the input JWT Token
- Generate new JWT Token by changing algorthim to `None` and `HS256/384/512`
