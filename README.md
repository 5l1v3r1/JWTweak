# JWTweak

### Introduction
This tool is basically designed to automate the progress of changing the JWT algorithm of input JWT Token and then generate the new JWT based on changed algorithm.

#### Features
- Detect the algorithm of the input JWT Token [live]
- Base64 decode the input JWT Token [live]
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'None' [live]
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'HS256' [build ongoing]
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'HS384' [coming soon]
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'HS512' [coming soon]
